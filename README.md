## üêù **About Beevibe**
Beevibe is a Python package designed to make it easier to train advanced language models, like CamemBERT, on text datasets with specific themes and perform accurate inference on new sentences. Inspired by the intelligence and collaboration of bees, Beevibe is built to empower developers and researchers with tools that are efficient, intuitive, and scalable.

Beevibe leverages modern AI features to simplify workflows and enhance user experience. It integrates:
- OpenAI and Ollama interfaces for intelligent interaction.
- AI-assisted research, documentation, and result analysis.
- Automatic dataset summarization.
- Example-guided usage to facilitate onboarding.
- Easy creation of classification heads.

## üì¶ **Installation**

Install Beevibe using pip:

```bash
pip install Beevibe
```

---

## üöÄ **Quickstart**

### **1. Training a Model**
Train CamemBERT on your custom thematic dataset:

```python
from Beevibe import ModelTrainer

# Initialize the trainer
trainer = ModelTrainer(model="camembert-base", dataset="path/to/dataset.csv")

# Train the model
trainer.train(epochs=3, batch_size=16)

# Save the trained model
trainer.save("trained_model")
```

### **2. Performing Inference**
Use the trained model to classify or extract themes from new sentences:

```python
from Beevibe import ModelInference

# Load the trained model
inference = ModelInference("trained_model")

# Infer themes for a new sentence
result = inference.predict("This is a new sentence to classify.")

print("Predicted Theme:", result)
```
