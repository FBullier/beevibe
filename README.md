## üì¶ **Installation**

Install Beevibe using pip:

```bash
pip install Beevibe
```

---

## üöÄ **Quickstart**

### **1. Training a Model**
Train CamemBERT on your custom thematic dataset:

```python
from Beevibe import BeeCustomMaskModelForClassification, BeeTrainer

# Define classification head
head_layer_configs = [
        {"input_size": 768, "output_size": num_classes, "activation": None},
    ]

# Initialize model
bv_model = BeeCustomMaskModelForClassification(
    model_name = "camembert-base",
    num_labels = 5,
    layer_configs=head_layer_configs
)

# Initialize the trainer
trainer = BeeTrainer(model=bv_model)

# Train the model
ret = trainer.train(texts=texts, labels=labels, num_epochs=1)

# Save the trained model
trainer.save_model("./sav_model")

# Free CPU/GPU memory
trainer.release_model()

```

### **2. Performing Inference**
Use the trained model to classify or extract themes from new sentences:

```python
from Beevibe import BeeCustomMaskModelForClassification

# Load the trained model
bv_model = BeeCustomMaskModelForClassification.load_model_safetensors("./sav_model")

# Infer themes for a new sentence
result = bv_model.predict(["This is a new sentence to classify."])

print("Predicted Theme:", result)
```
